"@SpringBootApplication" is a Spring Boot Annotataion used to indicate that a class is
the main class of a spring Boot application. It is a combination of 3 annotation:
'@Configuration' + '@EnableAutoConfiguration' + '@ComponentScan'.

1)@Configuration :- It is an annotation which is used to indiacate that a class 
defines one or more Spring Beans. It is used to create Beans manually and customize 
their configuration, rather than using auto-configuration provided by spring Boot

- When a class is annotated with '@Configuration', Spring treats it as a source of
bean defination, similar to an XML-based configuration where we define bean in XML.

Example 


package com.Annotations.Spring_Annotations;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class MyConfig {
	
	@Bean
	public Student getStudent() { 
		return new Student();
	}

}

Student class define below:-
public class Student {
	public void study() {
		System.out.println("StudyinG!!");
	}

}


-In above example, the 'MyConfig' class is annoted with '@Configuration',
which indicates that it contains bean definations. 
The 'getStudent()' method is annotated with '@Bean', indicating that
it returns a bean to be managed by Spring

***Note:- 
By using 'Configuration'and other annotation, developers can create
complex and customized bean configurations, while taking advantage of Spring's
DEPENDENCY INJECTION and  IOC(Inversion of Control) feature.
